# StarClusters
Program that organizes over 178,000 stars into clusters using a linked list algorithm

The file Vizier.txt contains the stars and their coordinates and brightnesses. VizierReadme contains the column headings.

llfinal.pro is the program.  It prompts the user for a distance and step size and sorts the stars into clusters based on that distance and outputs
the results.  Because of the large amount of data, a linked list algorithm is used, otherwise computing time is too large for the 
program to finish in any reasonable timescale.

NOTE this program was designed for use with the IDL language
